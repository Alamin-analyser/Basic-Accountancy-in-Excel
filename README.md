# Basic Accountancy Project in Excel

In this project I have worked on how to create Ledger, Trial Balance, Income Statement and Balance Sheet.

I gave the company name New Learner Ltd and entered some random income and expenses to create Ledger and Trial Balance.

I created the Income Statment for the period of 1st Jan 2025 to 31st Mar 2025 by getting the data from Trial Balance.

Also I have create the Balance Sheet for 31st mar 2025.
